('To make a great sandwich, spread your spread, sauce or dressing from corner to corner on the bread. People rush this step and just do a swoosh down the middle. Every bite should be flavorful. Now that''s a sandwich!'),
('If you keep it simple and buy ingredients at farmers'' markets, the food can pretty much take care of itself. Do as little as possible to the food; consider leaving out an ingredient and relying on instinct'),
('For best results when you''re baking, leave butter and eggs at room temperature overnight.'),
('Homemade vinaigrettes have fewer ingredients and taste better than bottled ones. No need to whisk them: Just put all the ingredients in a sealed container and shake.'),
('For an easy weeknight meal, save and freeze leftover sauces from previous meals in ice cube trays. The cubes can be reheated in a sauté pan when you need a quick sauce.'),
('Recipes are only a guideline, not the Bible. Feel comfortable replacing ingredients with similar ingredients that you like. If you like oregano but not thyme, use oregano.'),
('Anytime you are using raw onions in a salsa and you are not going to eat that salsa in the next 20 minutes or so, be sure to rinse the diced onions under cold running water first, then blot dry. This will rid them of sulfurous gas that can ruin fresh salsa. It''s really important in guacamole, too.'),
('Do not use oil in the water when boiling pasta: It will keep the sauce from sticking to the cooked pasta.'),
('For safety, put a wine cork on the tip of a knife before putting the knife in a drawer.'),
('Plunge vegetables in ice water after blanching (boiling) them so they maintain a bright color.'),
('After you drain pasta, while it''s still hot, grate some fresh Parmesan on top before tossing it with your sauce. This way, the sauce has something to stick to.'),
('Buy fruit at its peak at a farmers'' market and freeze it in an airtight container so you can enjoy it year round.'),
('Season all of your food from start to finish. Seasoning in stages brings the most out of your ingredients and gives you the most flavor.'),
('Don''t go to the store with a shopping list. Go to the store, see what ingredients look good and then make your list.'),
('For better-tasting asparagus, cure the stalks: Peel them, roll in equal parts sugar and salt, and let them sit for 10 minutes, then rinse off and prepare as desired.'),
('Serving cake:
1. Serve at room temperature.
2. Don''t "pre-slice" cake more than 20 minutes in advance. It dries out too quickly.
3. You don''t have to eat the fondant. It''s really pretty, but if you don''t want a mouthful of pure sugar, peel it off.'),
('To optimize the juice you get from a lemon or lime, roll it hard under your palm for a minute before juicing. (Or — on the down low — microwave it for 10 to 15 seconds.)'),
('For perfect vegetable soup, start with diced carrots, onions, peppers and tomatoes sautéed in oil or butter before you add any liquid. This brings out the taste and caramelizes the sugars.'),
('Shoes off, music on, favorite beverage in hand — enjoy your time in the kitchen.'),
('Don''t be too hard on yourself — mistakes make some of the best recipes! Keep it simple.'),
('Prolong the lifespan of greens by wrapping them loosely in a damp paper towel and placing in a resealable plastic bag. That local arugula will last about four days longer.'),
('Want to know if your oil is hot enough for frying\? Here’s a tip: Stick a wooden skewer or spoon in the oil. If bubbles form around the wood, then you are good to go.'),
('When a recipe calls for zest, instead of grating it into a separate container or onto parchment paper, hold the zester over the mixing bowl and zest directly onto the butter or cream. The aromatic citrus oils that are sprayed into the bowl will give the dessert a zesty finish.'),
('Cook more often. Don’t study; just cook.'),
('Whenever you cook pasta, remove some of the pasta-cooking water (about 1/4 or 1/3 cup) just before draining. When you add the sauce of your choice to the pasta, add a little of the cooking liquid. This helps sauce to amalgamate; the starch in the water adds body and a kind of creaminess.');
